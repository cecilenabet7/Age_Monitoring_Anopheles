# Monitoring the Age of Field Anopheles Mosquitoes Using MALDI-TOF and Deep Learning by Mohammad,Nabet et al.

This repository provides an overview of a method for estimating the age of field mosquitoes and modelling the age structure of the population. It is based on the article **"Accurate prediction of Anopheles mosquito age for epidemiological monitoring of malaria transmission "** by Mohammad, Naudion et al. The repository includes Python codes, notebooks and the model architecture for regression prediction and other prediction methods applicable to any dataset.
